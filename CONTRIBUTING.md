# Contributing

## Before you start

**Bugs and typos:** open a pull request directly.

**New features and significant changes:** open an issue first. Features need to fit the scope of the project and use an approach we agree on before significant implementation work begins.

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergeyshmakov/data-path.git
cd data-path
npm ci
npm run dev          # watch mode — rebuilds on save
npm test             # run tests and type checks
```

## Code style

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) handles formatting and linting. The pre-commit hook runs automatically on `git commit`. To run it manually:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

## Commits

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The commit prefix determines the version bump:

| Prefix | Release |
|--------|---------|
| `feat:` | Minor (1.1.0) |
| `fix:` | Patch (1.0.1) |
| `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:` | No release |

Breaking changes use `feat!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the commit body.

The commit message format is validated on commit. If the format is wrong, the commit is rejected with a helpful message.

## Release

Merging to `main` triggers `semantic-release` — it determines the version from commit history, publishes to npm, and creates a GitHub release. No manual version bumps needed.
